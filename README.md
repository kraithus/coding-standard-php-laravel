# Basics
The coding standards borrow from the [PSR-1 Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards), for the database I did not go deep, these are borrowed from [this article](https://dev.to/ovid/database-naming-standards-2061) as I feel it covers what I find "right".

# Example Contents
I was lazy with some examples, so if you try the code and it does not work do inform me and I will give ChatGPT 3.5 a good beating.

# Abbreviations
##  PSR
PHP Standard Recommendation

# Reading these standards
Start from [1. collaboration](collaboration) go to [2. database](database) then finally work your way to [3. code](code)
