# Basics
The coding standards borrow from the [PSR-1 Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards), for the database I did not go deep, these are borrowed from [this article](https://dev.to/ovid/database-naming-standards-2061) as I feel it covers what I find "right".

# Example Contents
I was lazy with some examples, so if you try the code and it does not work do inform me and I will give ChatGPT 3.5 a good beating.

# Abbreviations
##  PSR
PHP Standard Recommendation

# Reading these standards
Start from [1. collaboration](collaboration) go to [2. database](database) then finally work your way to [3. code](code)

The `github mobile app` is very good, you can view the repo there too, it looks very elegant. You can pull so you see it in your own repos and read from there. Or you can clone and view the files using Okular or I don't know what other markdown readers exist. Any major commits will be communicated on the discord server in `#git-push-ping`
